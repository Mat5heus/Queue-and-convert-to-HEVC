# Video Conversion to HEVC Script with VAAPI/QSV Support

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and functions designed for video conversion to the HEVC format using hardware acceleration via VAAPI/QSV, a multimedia API available on Linux systems. The project includes utility scripts to manage disk space checks, command validation, progress tracking, device detection, and file processing.

## Key Features:

1. **Disk Space Check**: Monitors free space in specified directories before starting video conversion tasks.
2. **Command Validation**: Ensures essential tools (awk, bc) are available on the system.
3. **Progress Tracking**: Dynamically updates a progress bar based on conversion tasks using HEVC encoding.
4. **Device Detection for VAAPI**: Validates the presence and read permissions of the VAAPI GPU device required for hardware acceleration.
5. **File Handling & Validation**: Lists, compares, and processes video files recursively to ensure they are in a compatible format (HEVC) before conversion.
6. **Time Efficiency**: Uses `ffprobe` for quick duration estimation of input files without decoding them completely, minimizing processing time.
7. **HEVC Codec Detection**: Verifies if the target video files already utilize the HEVC codec and provides warnings otherwise.
8. **Incremental Logging & Reporting**: Maintains a log file (`output`) detailing script activities with appropriate error or warning messages for unsuccessful operations.
9. **TUI Integration (Terminal User Interface)**: Provides an interactive terminal display to visualize conversion progress, durations, and space savings in real time.

## Usage

To run the scripts efficiently, you should:

1. Make sure your system has `ffprobe` from FFmpeg installed. It's typically available with most multimedia packages on Linux distributions like Ubuntu.
   
2. Ensure VAAPI-capable hardware is present and correctly configured in your systemâ€™s kernel or drivers. If unsure, verify through the terminal by running:
   ```bash
   lspci -k | grep VGA
   ```
   Look for a VGA card with "VAAPI Decoding" marked under its properties.

3. Source this project into a directory named `video_conversion`:

   ```bash
   mkdir video_conversion && cd video_conversion
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-conversion.git .
   ```

4. Configure essential variables in the main script (`main.sh`) before execution:

   - `VAAPI_DEVICE` should point to your VAAPI device file (e.g., `/dev/dri/card0`).
   
   Example for Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   export VAAPI_DEVICE=/dev/dri/card0
   ```

5. Run the main script, setting up desired options such as the path to store logs (`LOG_FILE`) and the directory where you want to start processing videos (`INPUT_DIR`).

   ```bash
   ./main.sh --log-file output.log --input-dir /path/to/videos
   ```

6. View progress, errors, or warnings in real time using TUI via:

   - On Unix systems like Linux and macOS, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `output.log` is located:

     ```bash
     cd /path/to/video_conversion
     tail -f output.log
     ```

   Alternatively, use a tool like `tail -f` in combination with `less`:
   ```bash
   watch -n 2 'less output.log'
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The script will exit non-zero if it encounters unsuccessful operations (e.g., required tools missing, directory not accessible).
- For more control and customization, modify the `utils.sh` file for additional functionality like custom metrics or extended reporting.
- To ensure security and prevent unauthorized usage, keep this repository private unless intended for public use as a shared resource.
